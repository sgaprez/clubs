		<h2>Hey SGA leadership!</h2>
		<p>I whipped up this quick url + webpage that we can add information about club creation, participation, and important dates for budgets etc in! I know Oliver just mentioned it recently, but I figured it would be good to get at least some basic info out before the fall semester starts. If any of you think of anything particular you want to add, you can email the content to me or bring it up at a meeting. Also, if you have experience with html/css/git, I can add your github account to this website project so that you can update the website as well :)</p>
		<p>See you soon!! - hal</p>
